# TODO List

## Meta

- Review package.json "metadata" - license, git repo address

## Design / UX

- Play with colors to give a sense of urgency to fix old things (Talvez convidar a Rafa pra ajudar)

- Set max height for cards and add scroll to navigate through more items ("CompletedToday" component)

- Make things a bit slimmer? (Cards)
